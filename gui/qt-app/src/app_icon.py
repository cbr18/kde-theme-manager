"""Application icon resolution.

The installer ships an icon named :data:`ICON_NAME` (see
``resources/icons/ktm-theme-manager.svg`` and the ``Icon=`` key in
``resources/kde-theme-manager.desktop``). When the app runs from the source
tree that icon is not installed yet, so fall back to the Breeze theme icon.

The name deliberately does **not** start with ``kde-`` or ``plasma-``: KDE's
icon loader collapses ``<existing-icon>-<anything>`` to the existing icon, so
``kde-theme-manager`` silently resolved to the KDE logo (and
``plasma-theme-manager`` to the Plasma logo) instead of our own icon.
